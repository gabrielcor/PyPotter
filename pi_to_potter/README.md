# There are two versions of magic_wand.py
Want to recreate the Universal Studios Magical experience?  Try this out, in a couple of hours you can have your own magic wand, running on a Raspberry PI 3/4.

This uses machine learning, and background subtraction with OpenCV all on a little $35 raspberry pi.  Several people have now recreated the whole exerience using this tech.  It might even be better than the original, since *this* wand experience can be taught new tricks. ;)
